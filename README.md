# StructuralDamageClassification
Climate change has led to increased incidences of hurricanes, extreme heat, flooding, and wildfires within our communities. These natural hazards in addition to earthquakes necessitate ajor changes to protect structures from these extreme loading events or mitigate their effects in the aftermath of natural disasters by moving towards more resilient structural solutions. While resilient structural design methodologies accounts for the probability of these extreme loading events, the need to balance the economics of the structure with the risk of structural failure under these extreme events, and possibly provide solutions for immediate recovery and occupancy of infrastructures in case of major events, is deemed crucial. Hence, rapid structural damage detection is an extremely useful tool to achieve resilient structures and communities. Owing to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, in particular deep learning (DL) applications in image processing, structural health monitoring (SHM) in this context has grownextensively in recent years. In this project, we aim to contribute to this area of engineering by applying deep learning CNN models.
